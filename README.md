# Mobile Sign-Up Flow

## Overview
This repository contains the design files for a mobile application's sign-up and login flow. The design aims to provide users with a clear and straightforward process for accessing their accounts.

## Screens
- **Welcome Screen**: Introduces users to the app with an inviting illustration. Offers options to either log in using existing credentials or create a new account.
- **Sign Up Screen**: Allows new users to create an account by filling out their username, email address, and password (with confirmation). Also provides alternative registration via Google.
- **Login Screen**: Provides returning users with input fields for their email/username and password. Includes options for account recovery ("Forgot Password?") as well as alternative login via Google.

## Design Highlights
- Clean layout with intuitive navigation between screens.
- User-friendly form inputs enhance user experience.
- Consistent visual elements across all screens maintain brand identity.

## Usage
These designs can be used as templates for developing actual application screens that require user authentication through sign-up/login procedures.
